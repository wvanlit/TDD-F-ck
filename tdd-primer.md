# TDD Primer

## What is TDD?

TDD stands for Test Driven Development. It is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. The developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## Why TDD?

TDD forces the developer to think about the requirements of the code before writing it. It also ensures that the code is testable and that the tests are automated.
By focusing on the requirements it is less likely that the developer will write code that is not needed.

## The TDD Cycle

1. Write a test and run it (it should fail)
2. Write the minimum amount of code to pass the test
3. Refactor the code to acceptable standards
4. Repeat

This cycle is also known as *Red-Green-Refactor*.
